## About
This is my personal portfolio page where I showcase my projects, skills, and experience. The website is built using GitHub Pages and styled with w3.css.

## Features
- Responsive design
- Clean and modern layout
- Easy to navigate

## Prerequisites
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Git

## Content
- `index.html` Edit the HTML to update your personal information, projects, skills, and contact details.
- `style.css` Modify the CSS to change the look and feel of your site.

## Usage
This project is designed to be a simple, static site with Responsive web design (RWD) that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.. You can modify the HTML and CSS files to customize the content and appearance of your portfolio. To tailor the content and appearance of your portfolio, you can choose a [W3.CSS Template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp) that best suits your needs and preferences. Once selected, simply integrate the template, and your site will be ready to go.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To set up your own GitHub Pages site, you need to create a special repository named `<username>.github.io`, where `<username>` is your GitHub username. Or you can simply follow the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages).

To deploy any changes to your portfolio, simply push your updates to the `main` branch of your repository. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and update your site with the latest changes.
