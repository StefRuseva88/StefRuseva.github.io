        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <p>Welcome to my pet supplies store project! Let me share the story behind it. For years, I thrived in the tourism industry, a path ingrained in my family's history. Then, the unexpected hit: the COVID-19 pandemic halted everything. But I refused to halt alongside it. Instead, I delved deep into my core passions: nature and technology.</p>
            <p>With a clear vision, harnessing my love for animals, nature, and positive energy, I launched my own pet store. It wasn't just about commerce, it was about connecting with what mattered most to me.</p>
            <p>Assembling a dedicated team, we embarked on the creation of an e-commerce website. Our team included a developer, designer, salesperson, accountant, and a fulfillment company. But there was a missing piece: someone who can test everything...and that is how I found out about my relationship with testing.</p>
            <p>Enter my newfound enthusiasm for software, a realm I had yet to explore. Despite being unfamiliar territory, I embraced the challenge wholeheartedly. This project became my initiation into the world of software testing, and I poured my heart into ensuring its success.</p>
            <p>I'm thrilled to be part of this exciting new world of opportunities. If I have one regret, it's that I didn't start this journey sooner. But hey, better late than never, right?</p>
            <p>Today, I look back at this like a testament to my determination, adaptability, and the power of pursuing one's passions.</p>

        <h2>Interests:</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my interests section, where you can discover the diverse passions that fuel my life beyond the realm of software testing.</p>
        <p>Animals and nature have always held a special place in my heart. Whether it's spending time outdoors, exploring new hiking trails, or simply observing the wonders of the natural world, I find solace and inspiration in the beauty of our planet and its inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Martial arts and dancing are not just physical activities for me; they are expressions of discipline, creativity, and self-expression. Through martial arts, I cultivate focus, strength, and resilience, while dancing allows me to connect with my emotions and express myself freely.</p>
        <p>Traveling is another passion of mine, as it provides endless opportunities for exploration, cultural immersion, and personal growth. Whether I'm wandering through bustling city streets or venturing off the beaten path, I cherish every moment of discovery and adventure.</p>
        <p>In the kitchen, cooking becomes an art form, allowing me to experiment with flavors, textures, and techniques to create delicious and nourishing meals. It's a creative outlet that brings joy to both myself and those I share my culinary creations with.</p>
        <p>Art in all its forms - be it painting, sculpture, or music - ignites my imagination and stimulates my senses. I find inspiration in the works of artists past and present, and I enjoy exploring galleries, attending concerts, and immersing myself in creative experiences whenever possible.</p>
        <p>These interests and hobbies not only enrich my life but also contribute to my holistic approach to personal and professional development. They remind me to embrace curiosity, embrace diversity, and embrace the beauty of the world around us.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to explore my interests, and I hope you find inspiration and connection in the shared passions we cherish.</p>
