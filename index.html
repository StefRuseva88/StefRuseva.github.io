        <h2>My Projects:</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <p>Welcome to my pet supplies store project! Let me share the story behind it. For years, I thrived in the tourism industry, a path ingrained in my family's history. Then, the unexpected hit: the COVID-19 pandemic halted everything. But I refused to halt alongside it. Instead, I delved deep into my core passions: nature and technology. üåøüíª</p>
            <p>With a clear vision, harnessing my love for animals, nature, and positive energy, I launched my own pet store. It wasn't just about commerce, it was about connecting with what mattered most to me. üê∂üõçÔ∏è</p>
            <p>Assembling a dedicated team, we embarked on the creation of an e-commerce website. Our team included a developer, designer, salesperson, accountant, and a fulfillment company. But there was a missing piece: someone who can test everything...and that was the beginning of my relationship with testing. üíªüõ†Ô∏è</p>
            <p>Enter my newfound enthusiasm for software, a realm I had yet to explore. Despite being unfamiliar territory, I embraced the challenge wholeheartedly. This project became my initiation into the world of software testing, and I poured my heart into ensuring its success. ‚ù§Ô∏èüìà</p>
            <p>I'm thrilled to be part of this exciting new world of opportunities. </p>
            <p>Today, I look back at this like a testament to my determination, adaptability, and the power of pursuing one's passions.</p>

        <p>And here's a glimpse into some of the testing techniques and methodologies I've learned and performed, along with examples of how they are applied: </p>   
        <p><strong>Accessibility Testing:</strong> Ensuring that software applications are accessible to users with disabilities, including testing for compatibility with assistive technologies and adherence to accessibility standards. Example: Testing a web application to ensure that it can be navigated using a screen reader software.</p>
        <p><strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong> Verifying that software meets the acceptance criteria and requirements defined by stakeholders, typically performed before the software is released to production. Example: Testing an e-commerce platform to ensure that users can successfully complete the checkout process and make purchases.</p>
        <p><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong> Testing the functionality of a software application without knowledge of its internal code or structure, focusing on inputs and outputs. Example: Testing a login page by entering valid and invalid credentials and verifying the expected behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>End-to-End Testing:</strong> Testing the entire software application, including all integrated components and external dependencies, to verify its functionality and performance in a real-world environment. Example: Testing a mobile banking application to ensure that users can transfer funds, view transaction history, and receive notifications.</p>
        <p><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Validating that each function of the software application behaves as expected, based on specified requirements and user interactions. Example: Testing a calculator application to ensure that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations produce accurate results.</p>
        <p><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Testing the interaction between different modules or components of the software application to ensure they work together seamlessly. Example: Testing an e-commerce website to ensure that product information is accurately displayed on the product page and in the shopping cart.</p>
        <p><strong>Load Testing:</strong> Evaluating the performance of a software application under expected or peak load conditions, assessing its ability to handle concurrent user interactions and data processing. Example: Simulating a large number of concurrent users accessing a social media platform to measure response times and server load.</p>
        <p><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Assessing the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a software application under various conditions, including different levels of user load and system resources. Example: Testing a video streaming service to ensure smooth playback and minimal buffering across different devices and network connections</p>
        <p><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Verifying that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality, typically performed after software updates or modifications. Example: Testing a software application after implementing a new feature to ensure that previously working functionalities still operate as expected</p>
        <p><strong>Sanity Testing:</strong> Conducting preliminary testing to quickly determine whether a software application is ready for more comprehensive testing, focusing on critical functionality. Example: Testing a web application after a minor code change to verify that the login functionality still works before proceeding with further testing.</p>
        <p><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a software application's security controls and defenses, including testing for potential exploits and breaches. Example: Conducting penetration testing on a financial application to identify and address security vulnerabilities in the login system.</p>
        <p><strong>Smoke Testing:</strong> Conducting initial testing to verify that basic functionalities of a software application work as expected, typically performed after a build or deployment. Example: Testing a newly developed mobile app to ensure that it launches without crashing and that users can navigate to the main features.</p>
        <p><strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Assessing the robustness and reliability of a software application under extreme conditions, such as high user load, resource constraints, or adverse environmental factors. Example: Subjecting an online ticket booking system to a high volume of simultaneous user requests to determine its capacity and scalability.</p>
        <p><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual units or components of a software application in isolation, typically performed by developers to validate code functionality. Example: Writing test cases to verify the behavior of a specific function or method in a software module.</p>
        <p><strong>White Box Testing:</strong> Testing the internal logic, structure, and implementation of a software application, based on knowledge of its internal code and design. Example: Analyzing the source code of a web application to identify potential vulnerabilities and security flaws. These testing techniques and methodologies enable me to thoroughly evaluate the quality, functionality, and performance of software applications, ensuring their reliability and user satisfaction. </p>
